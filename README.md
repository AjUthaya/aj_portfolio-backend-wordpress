### Twig

Twig is a template engine for the PHP programming language. Its syntax originates from Jinja and Django templates. It's an open source product licensed under a BSD License and maintained by Fabien Potencier. The initial version was created by Armin Ronacher. Symfony2 PHP framework comes with a bundled support for Twig as its default template engine.

### NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.

### NVM

Node Version Manager (nvm) is a tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same machine. Each version runs in its own isolated environment, so you can safely switch versions without affecting the whole system.

### NPM

npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

### Webpack

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

### HTML

### Sentry

Sentry is an open-source error tracking platform that provides complete app logic, deep context, and visibility across the entire stack in real time. For the first time, developers can fix bugs at every stage of the product lifecycle, well before users ever encounter a problem.

### Cypress

Cypress is free, open source, and locally installed front end testing tool. It can be used by developers or QA engineers, who build web applications using JavaScript framework. One can do unit testing, integration testing and end to end testing by writing test case using Cypress. Using cypress, one can test anything that can run in browser.
